I"Ÿ<p>Now Iâ€™ve finished the Generation course and passed my AWS exam, I have no deadlines or anything specific that I have to do for a set time and, as Iâ€™m still pretty new to coding and am just trying to climb out of the lower levels, I figured now would be a great time to get familiar with an IDE to make my progression through the next stages that much easier and Iâ€™ve got to say that, even after just going through the introductory interactive playground and writing this (the first thing Iâ€™ve done in VSCode), I can see it being a huge help and stopping me making many small mistakes that would waste a lot of my time and energy trying to pick out myself.</p>
