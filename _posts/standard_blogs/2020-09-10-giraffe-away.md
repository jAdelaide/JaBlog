## This is a short blog about the creation of this blog! How meta


After several days of procrastination and starting other projects I finally got round to finishing the Giraffe Academy tutorial videos for setting up a static site and I've gotta say, it ain't at all half shabby!

With the completion of the set up of the blog, it has suddenly dawned on me that I've given no thought to what I'm going to blog about, how regularly I want to do it, if I want to change the layout or style of the blog further etc... I guess we'll see what comes, I'll try to write blogs about any projects I do end up undertaking but who knows if I'll even know what to say then! I've also just realised how accustomed I've become to the under pressure, smiling, sweating emoji guy so maybe I'll figure out how to get emojis on here at some point (thinking face emoji).
